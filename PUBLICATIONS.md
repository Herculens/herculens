## Galaxy properties & evolution

- "**_El Gordo needs El Anzuelo: Probing the structure of cluster members with multi-band extended arcs in JWST data_**" ([**Galan et al. 2024a**](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A.304G/abstract)): high-resolution and multi-wavelength reconstruction of a star-forming galaxy by three members of the supermassive cluster _El Gordo_, using 3D correlated fields. <ins>Please cite this work if you use the `CorrelatedField` model of `Herculens`; please also cite the [`NIFTy.re` paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024JOSS....9.6593E/abstract), which implements the underlying forward model</ins> ([bibtex entries](CITATION.md)).

## Dark matter with strong lenses

- "**_The overconcentrated dark halo in the strong lens SDSS J0946+1006 is a subhalo: evidence for self interacting dark matter?_**" ([**Enzi et al. 2024**](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241108565E/abstract)): multi-plane field modeling of the unique _Jackpot_ lensing system to measure robustly the mass density profile of a dark matter substructure, further confirming its CDM-challenging nature.

## Confirmation of lens candidates

- "**_Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The Strong Lensing Discovery Engine D â€” Double-source-plane lens candidates_**" ([**Li et al. 2025**](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250315327E/abstract)): detailed lens models of five double-source-plane lens candidates found in Euclid data, including four confirmed to have two sources at different redshifts by the models.

## Methodology & exploration of systematics

- "**_Modeling lens potentials with continuous neural fields in galaxy-scale strong lenses_**" ([**Biggio et al. 2023**](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...675A.125B/abstract)): proof-of-concept of the use of continuous neural fields coupled to usual lens models to reconstruct the lensing potential maps at high resolution.

- "**_Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases in strong lensing analyses_**" ([**Galan et al. 2024b**](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...692A..87G/abstract)): Consistent comparison of 6 different modelling methods, including two methods implemented in `Herculens`, to characterize and reduce sources of systematic errors in strong lens modelling analyses.
